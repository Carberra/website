tagline: >
  Ya know, Python is awesome!
  There's so many cool things it can do, but a lot of them aren't as well known as they should be.
  This series aims to be a knowledge-centre for such things.

## Required

- Python
- A code editor
- Various packages, as defined in videos

## Notes

1. This series primarily uses Python 3.10.
2. The factorial implementation in the "Cython makes Python INSANELY FAST" video is incorrect, leading to invalid benchmarks.
   The thumbnail reports the true speed increase at 40x, taken from the sorting implementation.
