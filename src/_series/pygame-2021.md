## Required

* Python 3.5.0 or greater
* PyGame 2.0.0 or greater

## Optional

* NumPy 1.6.2 or greater

## Notes

1. PyGame recommends Python 3.7.7 or greater for performance reasons.
2. NumPy is only required if you want to use the [SurfArray module](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surfarray.html). It is not used in the series.
