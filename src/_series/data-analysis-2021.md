## Required

* Python 3.7.1 or greater
* A Jupyter notebook compatible editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or the [Jupyter online editor](https://jupyter.org/)
* pandas 1.2.0 or greater
* seaborn 0.11.0 or greater
* scikit-learn 0.20.0 or greater
* openpyxl 3.0.0 or greater
* Some data to analyse! If you're stuck for ideas, you can use [these datasets](https://github.com/Carberra/data-analysis-tutorial/tree/main/datasets)

## Optional

* ipykernel 5.0.0 or greater
* analytix

## Notes

1. The ipykernel package is only necessary if you do not use the Jupyter online editor.
2. analytix was used to get the datasets analysed in the series, and does not feature within it.
