## Development

Instructions for development/getting a development enviornment setup.

- Make sure you have the correct Node.JS and Yarn versions installed.
- Run `yarn` in top folder to install packages from `package.json`.
- Start the development server by running `yarn dev`.
- Open http://localhost:3000 (dev server) in your browser.

#### Running Storybook

- Follow the above steps first
- Start storybook by running `yarn storybook`.
- Open http://localhost:6006 (storybook server) in your browser.

## Production

To run the app in production, you will need to use docker and docker-compose to
run both the Plausible server as well as the Next JS server. Folders for the servers
should also be cloned into `/var/www/`.

#### Running Next JS

Run the following commands from the top folder (this one). Also, if another
version is already running, make sure to stop that container first.

- Build docker image: `docker build . -t carberra/website:<build version>`
- Run docker image: `docker run -p 3000:3000 --name carberra-website --rm -d carberra/website:<build version>`

#### Running Next JS (Automatically)

If you would like to run a single command to build and relaunch the docker container,
you can use the `build-and-deploy` script which should be in path (if you ran `setup.sh`
when you were setting it up). All you have to pass into the `build-and-deploy` script is
a version (eg. `v1.0.0`) and it should handle the rest for you.

#### Running Plausible

Run the following commands from the Plausible hosting folder (the one cloned below).

##### First Time Only

- Clone hosting repo: `git clone https://github.com/plausible/hosting plausible`
- Fill in info in `plausible-conf.env` (admin creds, etc).
  - Generate secket key to put in `SECRET_KEY_BASE` by running `openssl rand -base64 64`
- Run the commands below under the every time header
- Verify all users: `docker exec plausible_plausible_db_1 psql -U postgres -d plausible_db -c "UPDATE users SET email_verified = true;"`

##### Every time

- Build and start required images: `docker-compose up -d`
